A.1.1.6 What is the minimum duration of study of the 80%-slowest students? 12 semesters. A.1.1.7 What is the duration of study for exact 20% of all students? 13 semesters. A.1.2 Part B Now we consider the feature \\(Y\\): duration of study with levels: small (less than 12 semesters) medium (12 semesters) large (more than 12 semesters) A.1.2.1 How is the feature Y scaled? It is ordinal-scaled. A.1.2.2 Plot the absolute frequency function. # Function that converts duration to level duration_to_level &lt;- function(x) { if (x &lt; 12) &quot;small&quot; else if (x == 12) &quot;medium&quot; else &quot;large&quot; } # Vectorize this function in order to work with vector input duration_to_level &lt;- Vectorize(duration_to_level) # Prepare dataset tbl &lt;- select(tbl, duration, rel_frequency, abs_frequency) %&gt;% mutate(level = duration_to_level(duration)) %&gt;% group_by(level) %&gt;% summarise(rel_frequency = sum(rel_frequency), abs_frequency = sum(abs_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## level rel_frequency abs_frequency ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 large 0.4 80 ## 2 medium 0.4 80 ## 3 small 0.2 40 # Plot ggplot(tbl) + geom_col(aes(x = level, y = abs_frequency)) A.1.2.3 Does it make sense to use a cumulative distribution function for a nominal-scaled feature? No. A.2 Exercise A2 A.2.1 100m race The 100m times of 20 athletes were measured. They obtained the following cumulative distribution function: A.2.1.1 Draw the corresponding histogram break_left &lt;- c(10, 10.2, 10.6, 10.8) break_right &lt;- c(10.2, 10.6, 10.8, 11) f &lt;- c(0.1 / 0.2, 0.5 / 0.4, 0.2 / 0.2, 0.2 / 0.2) tbl &lt;- tibble(break_left = break_left, break_right = break_right, f = f) ggplot(tbl, aes(xmin = break_left, xmax = break_right, ymax = f)) + geom_rect(ymin = 0) + labs(x = &quot;x&quot;, y = &quot;f(x)&quot;) A.2.1.2 Which was the maximum time of the 80%-fastest athletes? 10.8 seconds. A.2.1.3 What is the assumption about the distribution of measured values within a group when determining the cumulative distribution function? Uniform distribution within a group. A.2.1.4 Use the cumulative distribution function to determine which was the maximum time needed by the five fastest athletes. # Interpolation t_max &lt;- 10.2 + (0.25 - 0.1) / (0.6 - 0.1) * (10.6 - 10.2) t_max ## [1] 10.32 A.3 Exercise A3 A.3.1 Tennis In a year tennis ace Boris B. participated in 40 tournaments all around the world. Every tournament consisted of six rounds: * 1st Round * 2nd Round * 3rd Round (Round of 16) * 4th Round (Round of 8) * 5th Round (Semi-Final) * 6th Round (Final) Boris is not satisfied with his overall performance. Even though he reached the final two times and was six times only defeated in the semi-final, he lost ten times in the 1st Round and 16 times in the 2nd Round. He never dropped out in the 3rd Round. A.3.1.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? The feature is the number of the highest round Boris reached in a tournament. It is interval-scaled. A.3.1.2 Determine absolute and relative frequencies as well as absolute and relative cumulative frequencies. x &lt;- 1:6 abs_frequency &lt;- c(10, 16, 0, 6, 6, 2) tbl &lt;- tibble(x = x, abs_frequency = abs_frequency) tbl &lt;- tbl %&gt;% mutate(rel_frequency = abs_frequency / sum(abs_frequency)) %&gt;% mutate(cum_abs_frequency = cumsum(abs_frequency)) %&gt;% mutate(cum_rel_frequency = cumsum(rel_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## x abs_frequency rel_frequency cum_abs_frequency cum_rel_frequency ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 10 0.25 10 0.25 ## 2 2 16 0.4 26 0.65 ## 3 3 0 0 26 0.65 ## 4 4 6 0.15 32 0.8 ## 5 5 6 0.15 38 0.95 ## 6 6 2 0.05 40 1 A.3.1.3 Draw the empirical relative distribution function. ggplot(tbl) + geom_col(aes(x = x, y = rel_frequency)) A.3.1.4 At what percentage of tournaments Boris dropped out before the 3rd Round? 26 / 40. A.3.1.5 At what percentage of tournaments Boris reached at least the semi-finals? 8 / 40. A.3.1.6 At how many tournaments Boris played at least in the 2nd Round? A.3.1.7 At most which round Boris dropped out in 80% of all tournaments? 4th Round. A.3.1.8 Which round Boris dropped out in exact 40% of all tournaments? 2nd Round. A.3.1.9 Give an interpretation of F(x) at x = 7. \\(F(7) = 1\\), because \\(F(x) = 1 \\, \\forall \\, x &gt;= 6\\). That means it is impossible to ever reach the 7th Round as it does not exist. A.4 Exercise A4 A.4.1 Study time 100 students were asked how much time they spend for their studies per day. None of them spent more than 12 hours. 22 students spent more than six hours. 30% of all interviewed students were spending less than three hours, whereas 65% of students invest between three and eight hours per day. A.4.1.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? The feature is the time a student spends for her studies per day in hours. It is ratio-scaled. A.4.1.2 Determine absolute, relative and cumulative frequencies. Group the data in four groups. n &lt;- 100 break_left &lt;- c(0, 3, 6, 8) break_right &lt;- c(3, 6, 8, 12) # 22 students spent more than six hours -&gt; 5 students spent more than 12 hours, # 17 student spent between six and height hours f &lt;- c(0.3, 0.48, 0.17, 0.05) tbl &lt;- tibble(break_left = break_left, break_right = break_right, rel_frequency = f) %&gt;% mutate(abs_frequency = rel_frequency * n) %&gt;% mutate(cum_rel_frequency = cumsum(rel_frequency)) %&gt;% mutate(cum_abs_frequency = cumsum(abs_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 4 x 6 ## break_left break_right rel_frequency abs_frequency cum_rel_frequen~ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 3 0.3 30 0.3 ## 2 3 6 0.48 48 0.78 ## 3 6 8 0.17 17 0.95 ## 4 8 12 0.05 5 1 ## # ... with 1 more variable: cum_abs_frequency &lt;dbl&gt; A.4.1.3 Visualize the absolute frequencies. ggplot(tbl) + geom_rect( aes( xmin = break_left, xmax = break_right, ymin = 0, ymax = abs_frequency / (break_right - break_left) ), fill = &quot;gray&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) + labs(x = &quot;x&quot;, y = &quot;h(x)&quot;) A.4.1.4 Why did you choose this kind of visualization? I choose a histogram as it is a meaningful visualization for ratio-scaled data. Dont forget to divide by the group width. The area of a group is proportionate to its absolute frequency and not its height. A.4.1.5 Visualize the relative cumulative frequencies. x &lt;- c(0, tbl$break_right) cum_rel_frequency &lt;- c(0, tbl$cum_rel_frequency) tbl &lt;- tibble(x = x, cum_rel_frequency = cum_rel_frequency) ggplot(tbl, aes(x = x, y = cum_rel_frequency)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;x&quot;, y = &quot;F(x)&quot;) A.4.1.6 Which assumption was made for your visualization? The distribution within a group is uniform. A.4.1.7 Use your visualization to find out how many hours at most spent 50% of all students? # Interpolation t_max &lt;- 3 + (0.5 - 0.3) / (0.78 - 0.3) * (6 - 3) t_max ## [1] 4.25 A.4.1.8 How many students work more than five hours per day for their studies? # F(5) F_5 &lt;- 0.3 + (5 - 3) / (6 - 3) * (0.78 - 0.3) F_5 ## [1] 0.62 # Solution (1 - F_5) * n ## [1] 38 A.5 Exercise A5 A.5.1 Ice cream This exercise does not cover anything new and is therefore left as an exercise to the reader. Ice cream seller Benedict wants to sell fresh ice cream to his customers every day. So that he always has the right quantities in stock, he counts the consumption of ice cream scoops on one day for 200 customers. Here it turns out: No customer is ordering two scoops or more than six scoops. 20% each wanted one scoop or at least five scoops. Less than three scoops were ordered by 45% of all customers. Ten times more customers wanted four or six scoops than five scoops. A.5.1.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? A.5.1.2 Determine absolute and cumulative absolute frequencies. A.5.1.3 Visualize the absolute frequencies. A.5.1.4 Visualize the relative cumulative frequencies. A.5.1.5 What percentage of customers ordered five or less scoops? A.5.1.6 How many scoops were bought from the 80% customers with the most scoops? A.5.1.7 How many scoops were bought from exact 35% of customers?

For this purpose he needs all orders with the respective quantities [in thousands of pieces]. The computer of the company provides him with the data of this week in the following graphic representation: B.2.1.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? B.2.1.2 Determine absolute and relative frequencies. B.2.1.3 Determine (without calculating) the value of the arithmetic mean and the median. Justify your answer briefly. B.2.1.4 Determine the empirical variance. B.2.1.5 Group order quantities in the following groups: 0 - 20 | 20 - 40 | 40 - 60 B.2.1.6 Determine the value of the arithmetic mean and the empirical variance from the grouped data. B.2.1.7 Explain possible differences of the parameter values between original and grouped data The production manager wants to distribute the production of the ordered tools to the three machines A, B and C. Machine A is to produce exactly 40% of this weeks order volume. For technical reasons, the quantity produced by machine B depends on the production quantity of machine A and is only 25% of the quantity produced by machine A. The rest of the order volume is to be produced by machine C. B.2.1.8 How many tools are produced by machine A? B.2.1.9 What percentage of the total order volume is produced by machine B? B.2.1.10 How many tools are produced by machine C? B.3 Exercise B3 B.3.1 Part A As part of a medical examination, 200 people were asked how many cups of coffee they drink per week. The result of this examination is shown in the following graph: B.3.1.1 What do you call this graphic representation? What was assumed about the distribution of the data? B.3.1.2 Draw the absolute frequency distribution. Which principle should be observed? B.3.1.3 Determine the arithmetic mean and median from the data. B.3.1.4 Interpret both values in terms of how the data is distributed. B.3.1.5 Indicate the percentage of people who drink at least 20 cups of coffee per week. Lets assume that when you look through the data again, you find that the frequencies of the 3rd group and the 4th group have been swapped. B.3.1.6 Does this change the value of the median? B.4 Exercise B4 B.4.1 Part A An arithmetic mean of \\(\\bar{x} = 2813\\) was determined from \\(n = 78\\) observations. In addition to these observations, an observation of 2100 was added.

In order to avoid losing touch with the computer world, he likes to be kept up to date with all the latest developments. For this purpose he connected his computer (all day long) to a so-called internet server, for which he has to pay hefty telephone charges. Due to a tariff change of the telephone company, Bert now fears that he can no longer afford this luxury, which is exactly the case when he has to pay more than 6 EUR per hour on average for the telephone connection. Tariff Time from  up to less than  Talk time in seconds per cost unit of 8 Cent Night Tariff 01:00 - 06:00 120 Morning Tariff 06:00 - 12:00 40 Afternoon Tariff 12:00 - 19:00 30 Evening Tariff 19:00 - 01:00 60 B.5.1.1 Calculate for the new tariff how much the telephone connection costs on average in EUR per hour. So can Bert still afford his hobby in the future? B.6 Exercise B6 B.6.1 Part A The following empirical distribution function \\(F(x)\\) was obtained for the monthly gross income [in 1000 EUR] of the 2000 employees of a company: B.6.1.1 What is the name of the statistical feature examined here and how is it scaled? B.6.1.2 Determine the absolute and the relative frequency distribution of this characteristic B.6.1.3 Visualize the absolute frequency distribution. B.6.1.4 According to your visualization, how big is the percentage of employees who earn exactly 6400 EUR per month? B.6.1.5 Calculate how many percent of the employees earn more than 5800 EUR per month. B.6.1.6 What is the (estimated) monthly gross income of all employees of this company? B.6.1.7 What is the average monthly gross income in this company by the arithmetic mean / the median? B.6.1.8 Calculate the empirical quartile coefficient of skewness. B.6.1.9 Assess the skewness of the present frequency distribution according to the position rule / the empirical quartile coefficient of skewness. B.7 Exercise B7 B.7.1 Multiple Choice Questions B.7.1.1 One speaks of the principle of equal area when, in the graphic representation of absolute frequencies of grouped data, the flatness of a block is proportional to the absolute frequency to be represented. True. B.7.1.2 The frequency distributions of two cardinally scaled features do not have to be identical even if the two features have the same arithmetic mean and the same variance. True. B.7.1.3 Statistical quantities can be classified with respect to their value range. True. B.7.1.4 The empirical distribution function is not only defined for values that were also observed. False? Empirical means observed. One could argue that she could use aggregated values instead of bare observations. B.7.1.5 The empirical quartile distance of an ordered data set is a measure of variability which is outlier-sensitive. False. B.7.1.6 The step heights of an empirical (relative) distribution function correspond to the relative cumulative frequencies. False, they correspond to the relative frequencies. B.7.1.7 The coefficient of variation is a dimensionless measure. True. B.7.1.8 If: \\(h(a_j) = n\\) , then the underlying statistical characteristic has only one possibility of realization. False. Other possible realizations were just not observed, but may surely exist.

There is a suspicion that some pigs are infected with a certain, but not communicable disease, which can be detected by a blood test. The veterinarian suggests that a blood test be performed on each pig for a fee of 10 EUR per pig. However, the total fee of 200 EUR resulting from this proposal seems far too high for the farmer. Therefore, the farmer in turn suggests that the doctor mixes the blood taken from the animals in one compartment and analyzes this mixture for 10 EUR. Only if the results are positive should the doctor perform a single test on each pig in the compartment concerned. Whether the farmers method is advantageous (i.e. costs less than 200 EUR) depends on the probability \\(\\pi\\) of a pig being infected with the disease. G.1.1.1 First of all, think intuitively for which values of \\(\\pi\\) (rather small or rather large) the method proposed by the farmer is more cost-effective. G.1.1.2 Now decide mathematically for which values of \\(\\pi\\) the method suggested by the farmer is cheaper than the method suggested by the doctor by comparing the expected value of the doctors fee (if suggested by the farmer) with the fixed amount of the doctors fee (if suggested by the doctor). Suppose you were not an economist or business economist, but a farmer and had this problem to solve. Surely you would then have made a proposal to the veterinarian that was a bit more favourable and also more advantageous to you for a higher probability of illness \\(\\pi\\) than the method suggested by the veterinarian. Modify the farmers method described above accordingly. G.1.1.3 For what values of \\(\\pi\\) is your modified method now cheaper than the method suggested by the veterinarian?

H.1.2 Part B - Electric Component For an electronic component, you can expect 48 failures per day (24 hours). The failures are purely random and independent of each other. H.1.2.1 How is \\(Y\\): Time in hours between two failures distributed (distribution and parameters)? H.1.2.2 What is the probability that more than 2 hours will pass until the next failure ? H.1.2.3 Using this example, verbalize the following formula: \\[\\int\\limits_{1}^2 2 \\exp(-2y) \\mathrm{d} y\\] H.1.2.4 Assume that an electronic system consists of two of these components, which function independently of each other. The system fails as soon as one component stops working. What is the probability that the system will work for more than 2 hours ? H.2 Exercise H2 Borrowing books is very time-consuming, especially in large libraries with book magazines. So Student Bücherwurm studied the working methods of the Central Library of the TU Berlin in detail to be able to plan better. H.2.1 Part A Most of the books in the central library cannot be taken away immediately. So Bücherwurm fills out a loan slip and throws it into the order box. He knows that the boxes are regularly emptied on the hour and the loan slips are taken to the magazine. H.2.1.1 Bücherwurm throws the borrowers ticket into the box at a randomly chosen time when he is in the main building. How is the random variable \\(X\\): Waiting time until next emptying of the order box distributed (distribution and parameters)? H.2.1.2 On average, how long will a borrowers ticket remain in the box until it is placed in the magazine? H.2.2 Part B It also takes time to pick out the books from the magazine. Bücherwurm assumes that the random variable \\(Y\\): Waiting time between emptying the box and the book arriving at the book edition is normally distributed with a mean value of 2.5 hours and a standard deviation of 0.5 hours. H.2.2.1 What is the probability that the library will take more than 3.5 hours - counted from the time the order box is emptied - until the book arrives at the output? H.2.2.2 How long does Bücherwurm have to wait at the book counter after the Loan bills wait for the book on average? H.2.3 Part C In the library administration one knows that also some borrowers lose books. During the opening hours (8 hours) an average of 6 customers report a loss. H.2.3.1 How is the random variable \\(Z\\): Waiting time for the next customer to arrive with a lost item distributed (distribution and parameters)? H.2.3.2 On average, how many minutes elapse before the first lost customer reports a loss? H.2.3.3 What is the probability that within the first three hours after the library has been opened, no customer will arrive with a lost ticket? H.2.3.4 What is the probability that after a maximum of four hours the first loss is reported after no loss has been reported in the first three hours? H.3 Exercise H3 H.3.1 Steel pins One machine produces steel pins. Unfortunately, the diameter of the pins is subject to production-related fluctuations. \\(X_1\\): Diameter of a pin is normally distributed with \\(_1 = 6 \\, \\mathrm{mm}\\) and \\(_1 = 0.4 \\, \\mathrm{mm}\\). H.3.1.1 What is the probability that the diameter of a pin deviates by more than 2% from the nominal value 6 mm? H.3.1.2 What is the probability that the diameter of a pin is exactly 6 mm? H.3.1.3 What value of the diameter will not be exceeded with an 85% probability? A second machine, which operates independently of the first machine, drills holes in a workpiece into which the steel pins are to be inserted. The diameter of the drilled holes is also subject to fluctuations. \\(X_2\\): Diameter of a drill hole is normally distributed with \\(_2 = 6.05 \\, \\mathrm{mm}\\) and \\(_2 = 0.3 \\, \\mathrm{mm}\\). H.3.1.4 What is the probability that the diameter of a borehole is less than 6 mm? H.3.1.5 How is the random variable \\(Y = X_2 - X_1\\) distributed (distribution and parameters)? H.3.1.6 Formalize the statement: Pen fits into the drill hole. H.3.1.7 What is the probability that a pin will not fit into a drill hole? H.4 Exercise H4 The telephone switchboard of a fire station receives an average of 0.5 alarm messages per hour. H.4.0.1 How great is the probability that during the 6-hour service time of a fire department no alarm at least three times alarm maximum seven times alarm is given? H.4.0.2 What is the probability that the fire department gets the first alarm within the first hour of service? has to wait longer than 2 hours for the first alarm? has to move out to the first alarm in the last hour of service, of all times, after no alarm has been received in the entire 5 hour service period? H.4.0.3 The chief fire chief on duty declares to his fire department team that there is a 95% probability that the first alarm will occur during the teams duty period. Does the team really have to wait less than 6 hours to receive the first alarm with 95% probability ?
