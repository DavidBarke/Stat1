# Continuous Random Variables and Distributions

## Exercise H1

### Part A - Pocket calculator

A pocket calculator is powered by two different batteries. It works as long as both batteries work.

* The lifetime $X$ of the battery $A$ is normally distributed with $μ_X = 30$ hours and $σ_X = 3$ hours. 
* The life $Y$ of the $B$ battery is normally distributed with $μ_Y = 35$ hours and $σ_Y = 4$ hours.

$X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables.

#### What is the probability that the $A$ battery will last between 15 and 27 hours ?

#### What is the lifetime of the $B$ battery with a probability of $85.3141$% not to be exceeded ?

#### What is the probability that the calculator will still work after 24 hours?

#### What is the probability that the lifetime of the battery $A$ is less than the lifetime of the battery $B$ ?

### Part B - Electric Component

For an electronic component, you can expect 48 failures per day (24 hours). The failures are purely random and independent of each other.

#### How is $Y$: "Time in hours between two failures" distributed (distribution and parameters)?

#### What is the probability that more than 2 hours will pass until the next failure ?

#### Using this example, verbalize the following formula:

$$\int\limits_{1}^2 2 \exp(-2y) \mathrm{d} y$$

#### Assume that an electronic system consists of two of these components, which function independently of each other. The system fails as soon as one component stops working. What is the probability that the system will work for more than 2 hours ?

## Exercise H2

Borrowing books is very time-consuming, especially in large libraries with book magazines. So Student Bücherwurm studied the working methods of the Central Library of the TU Berlin in detail to be able to plan better.

### Part A

Most of the books in the central library cannot be taken away immediately. So Bücherwurm fills out a loan slip and throws it into the order box. He knows that the boxes are regularly emptied on the hour and the loan slips are taken to the magazine.

#### Bücherwurm throws the borrower's ticket into the box at a randomly chosen time when he is in the main building. How is the random variable $X$: "Waiting time until next emptying of the order box" distributed (distribution and parameters)?

#### On average, how long will a borrower's ticket remain in the box until it is placed in the magazine?

### Part B

It also takes time to pick out the books from the magazine. Bücherwurm assumes that the random variable $Y$: "Waiting time between emptying the box and the book arriving at the book edition" is normally distributed with a mean value of 2.5 hours and a standard deviation of 0.5 hours.

#### What is the probability that the library will take more than 3.5 hours - counted from the time the order box is emptied - until the book arrives at the output?

#### How long does Bücherwurm have to wait at the book counter after the Loan bills wait for the book on average?

### Part C

In the library administration one knows that also some borrowers lose books. During the opening hours (8 hours) an average of 6 customers report a loss.

#### How is the random variable $Z$: "Waiting time for the next customer to arrive with a lost item" distributed (distribution and parameters)?

#### On average, how many minutes elapse before the first lost customer reports a loss?

#### What is the probability that within the first three hours after the library has been opened, no customer will arrive with a lost ticket?

#### What is the probability that after a maximum of four hours the first loss is reported after no loss has been reported in the first three hours?

## Exercise H3

### Steel pins

One machine produces steel pins. Unfortunately, the diameter of the pins is subject to production-related fluctuations.

$X_1$: "Diameter of a pin" is normally distributed with $μ_1 = 6 \, \mathrm{mm}$ and $σ_1 = 0.4 \, \mathrm{mm}$.

#### What is the probability that the diameter of a pin deviates by more than 2% from the nominal value 6 mm?

#### What is the probability that the diameter of a pin is exactly 6 mm?

#### What value of the diameter will not be exceeded with an 85% probability?

A second machine, which operates independently of the first machine, drills holes in a workpiece into which the steel pins are to be inserted. The diameter of the drilled holes is also subject to fluctuations.

$X_2$: "Diameter of a drill hole" is normally distributed with $μ_2 = 6.05 \, \mathrm{mm}$ and $σ_2 = 0.3 \, \mathrm{mm}$.

#### What is the probability that the diameter of a borehole is less than 6 mm?

#### How is the random variable $Y = X_2 - X_1$ distributed (distribution and parameters)?

#### Formalize the statement: "Pen fits into the drill hole".

#### What is the probability that a pin will not fit into a drill hole?

## Exercise H4

The telephone switchboard of a fire station receives an average of 0.5 alarm messages per hour.

#### How great is the probability that during the 6-hour service time of a fire department

a) no alarm
b) at least three times alarm
c) maximum seven times alarm 

is given?

#### What is the probability that the fire department

a) gets the first alarm within the first hour of service?
b) has to wait longer than 2 hours for the first alarm?
c) has to "move out" to the first alarm in the last hour of service, of all times, after no alarm has been received in the entire 5 hour service period?

#### The chief fire chief on duty declares to his fire department team that there is a 95% probability that the first alarm will occur during the team's duty period. Does the team really have to wait less than 6 hours to receive the first alarm with 95% probability ?
