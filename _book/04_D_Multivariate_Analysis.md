## Exercise D1

In a survey, 200 father-son pairs were asked about their voting behavior in the last election. Create a contingency table using the following information:

1. The sons chose parties $A$, $B$ and $C$ in the ratio $2:1:2$.
2. Half of the fathers who voted for Party $B$ must face the fact that their sons prefer Party $A$.
3. 5% of the sons interviewed - like their fathers - chose party A.
4. Party B won 40% of all votes.
5. 15% of all fathers gave their vote to Party C.
6. 20 sons whose fathers voted for Party A chose Party B.
7. Only 30 fathers voted for the same party as their sons.

## Exercise D2

In the context of developing a marketing strategy for their latest product, the marketing department of a company conducted a survey in the hope of obtaining information about the most promising packaging color. For this purpose, a total of 600 units of the product were offered on three different test markets. Several employees have so far collected the following information about the pieces sold in the test markets:

1. The number of units sold on test market I was in line with the packaging color (black, red, white) in the ratio 1:3:1.
2. 30% of the pieces sold on the Test Market II were packed in black.
3. 25% of all offered pieces were not sold.
4. As many black-packaged pieces were sold as white-packaged pieces.
5. 175 pieces were sold on Test Market III.
6. The number of pieces sold on Test Market II represented 75% of the total number of red wrapped pieces sold on all Test Markets.
7. On Test Market I, 50 fewer pieces were sold than on Test Market III.
8. 35% of the red wrapped pieces sold were sold on Test Market III.

### Present the data obtained from the examination in tabular form in a contingency table.

### Determine the sales shares of the individual packaging colors in the various test markets.

### Based on the results obtained in 2), which packaging color is the marketing department likely to choose?

## Exercise D3

A survey was carried out in which the interviewed persons were asked to give information about their love for animals (yes/no). The respondents were divided into three categories (children, teenagers, adults).

The survey produced the following results:
1. Of the 400 children questioned, 80% are fond of animals.
2. 200 adults were interviewed.
3. The number of animal-loving adults was 140 less than the number of animal-loving children.
4. Altogether 80% (=800 persons) were animal-loving.

### What is the number of non-animal-loving adults?

### What percentage of respondents are not adults?

### How large is the proportion of animal-loving teenagers among those surveyed?

### How large is the proportion of teenagers among animal lovers?

### Do children love animals more than adults?

## Exercise D4

An investigation by the public health department in X-City revealed the following findings about infections with the virus Z in risk groups A, B and C:


|group | infected| not infected|
|:-----|--------:|------------:|
|A     |       18|           42|
|B     |        5|           31|
|C     |       17|           37|

The realizations of the feature _Group_ are denoted by $a_i, i \in \{A, B, C\}$, whereas the realizations of the feature _Infected_ are denoted by $b_j \, , j \in \{1, 2\}$.

###  Is the frequency f(a_i|b_j) more interesting for any member of one of these risk groups than the frequency f(b_j|a_i)? Explain.

### Is the infection level for group B the lowest in this investigation?

### Is the statement correct that in group B the fewest non-infected people were found?

### Is it correct to say that the proportion of non-infected people is smallest in group C?
