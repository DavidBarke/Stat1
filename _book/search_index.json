The following results were obtained: n &lt;- 200 duration &lt;- c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) rel_frequency &lt;- c(0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05) tbl &lt;- tibble(duration = duration, rel_frequency = rel_frequency) %&gt;% mutate(cum_rel_frequency = cumsum(rel_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## duration rel_frequency cum_rel_frequency ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 10 0.1 0.1 ## 2 11 0.1 0.2 ## 3 12 0.4 0.6 ## 4 13 0.2 0.8 ## 5 14 0.15 0.95 ## 6 15 0.05 1 A.1.1.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? The feature is the duration study of an industrial engineer. It is interval-scaled. A.1.1.2 Determine the absolute frequencies. tbl &lt;- mutate(tbl, abs_frequency = n * rel_frequency) tbl$abs_frequency ## [1] 20 20 80 40 30 10 A.1.1.3 Determine the cumulative absolute frequencies. tbl &lt;- mutate(tbl, cum_abs_frequency = cumsum(abs_frequency)) tbl$cum_abs_frequency ## [1] 20 40 120 160 190 200 A.1.1.4 Plot frequencies and cumulative (relative and absolute). # Relative frequencies ggplot(tbl) + geom_col(aes(x = duration, y = rel_frequency)) # Relative cumulative frequencies ggplot(tbl) + geom_point(aes(x = duration, y = cum_rel_frequency)) # Absolute frequencies ggplot(tbl) + geom_col(aes(x = duration, y = abs_frequency)) # Absolute cumulative frequencies ggplot(tbl) + geom_point(aes(x = duration, y = cum_abs_frequency)) A.1.1.5 What is the maximum duration of study of the 10%-fastest students? 10 semesters. A.1.1.6 What is the minimum duration of study of the 80%-slowest students? 12 semesters. A.1.1.7 What is the duration of study for exact 20% of all students? 13 semesters. A.1.2 Part B Now we consider the feature \\(Y\\): duration of study with levels: small (less than 12 semesters) medium (12 semesters) large (more than 12 semesters) A.1.2.1 How is the feature Y scaled? It is ordinal-scaled. A.1.2.2 Plot the absolute frequency function. # Function that converts duration to level duration_to_level &lt;- function(x) { if (x &lt; 12) &quot;small&quot; else if (x == 12) &quot;medium&quot; else &quot;large&quot; } # Vectorize this function in order to work with vector input duration_to_level &lt;- Vectorize(duration_to_level) # Prepare dataset tbl &lt;- select(tbl, duration, rel_frequency, abs_frequency) %&gt;% mutate(level = duration_to_level(duration)) %&gt;% group_by(level) %&gt;% summarise(rel_frequency = sum(rel_frequency), abs_frequency = sum(abs_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## level rel_frequency abs_frequency ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 large 0.4 80 ## 2 medium 0.4 80 ## 3 small 0.2 40 # Plot ggplot(tbl) + geom_col(aes(x = level, y = abs_frequency)) A.1.2.3 Does it make sense to use a cumulative distribution function for a nominal-scaled feature? No. A.2 Exercise A2 The 100m times of 20 athletes were measured. They obtained the following cumulative distribution function: A.2.1 Draw the corresponding histogram break_left &lt;- c(10, 10.2, 10.6, 10.8) break_right &lt;- c(10.2, 10.6, 10.8, 11) f &lt;- c(0.1 / 0.2, 0.5 / 0.4, 0.2 / 0.2, 0.2 / 0.2) tbl &lt;- tibble(break_left = break_left, break_right = break_right, f = f) ggplot(tbl, aes(xmin = break_left, xmax = break_right, ymax = f)) + geom_rect(ymin = 0) + labs(x = &quot;x&quot;, y = &quot;f(x)&quot;) A.2.2 Which was the maximum time of the 80%-fastest athletes? 10.8 seconds. A.2.3 What is the assumption about the distribution of measured values within a group when determining the cumulative distribution function? Uniform distribution within a group. A.2.4 Use the cumulative distribution function to determine which was the maximum time needed by the five fastest athletes. # Interpolation t_max &lt;- 10.2 + (0.25 - 0.1) / (0.6 - 0.1) * (10.6 - 10.2) t_max ## [1] 10.32 A.3 Exercise A3 In a year tennis ace Boris B. participated in 40 tournaments all around the world. Every tournament consisted of six rounds: * 1st Round * 2nd Round * 3rd Round (Round of 16) * 4th Round (Round of 8) * 5th Round (Semi-Final) * 6th Round (Final) Boris is not satisfied with his overall performance. Even though he reached the final two times and was six times only defeated in the semi-final, he lost ten times in the 1st Round and 16 times in the 2nd Round. He never dropped out in the 3rd Round. A.3.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? The feature is the number of the highest round Boris reached in a tournament. It is interval-scaled. A.3.2 Determine absolute and relative frequencies as well as absolute and relative cumulative frequencies. x &lt;- 1:6 abs_frequency &lt;- c(10, 16, 0, 6, 6, 2) tbl &lt;- tibble(x = x, abs_frequency = abs_frequency) tbl &lt;- tbl %&gt;% mutate(rel_frequency = abs_frequency / sum(abs_frequency)) %&gt;% mutate(cum_abs_frequency = cumsum(abs_frequency)) %&gt;% mutate(cum_rel_frequency = cumsum(rel_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## x abs_frequency rel_frequency cum_abs_frequency cum_rel_frequency ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 10 0.25 10 0.25 ## 2 2 16 0.4 26 0.65 ## 3 3 0 0 26 0.65 ## 4 4 6 0.15 32 0.8 ## 5 5 6 0.15 38 0.95 ## 6 6 2 0.05 40 1 A.3.3 Draw the empirical relative distribution function. ggplot(tbl) + geom_col(aes(x = x, y = rel_frequency)) A.3.4 At what percentage of tournaments Boris dropped out before the 3rd Round? 26 / 40. A.3.5 At what percentage of tournaments Boris reached at least the semi-finals? 8 / 40. A.3.6 At how many tournaments Boris played at least in the 2nd Round? A.3.7 At most which round Boris dropped out in 80% of all tournaments? 4th Round. A.3.8 Which round Boris dropped out in exact 40% of all tournaments? 2nd Round. A.3.9 Give an interpretation of F(x) at x = 7. \\(F(7) = 1\\), because \\(F(x) = 1 \\, \\forall \\, x &gt;= 6\\). That means it is impossible to ever reach the 7th Round as it does not exist. A.4 Exercise A4 100 students were asked how much time they spend for their studies per day. None of them spent more than 12 hours. 22 students spent more than six hours. 30% of all interviewed students were spending less than three hours, whereas 65% of students invest between three and eight hours per day. A.4.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? The feature is the time a student spends for her studies per day in hours. It is ratio-scaled. A.4.2 Determine absolute, relative and cumulative frequencies. Group the data in four groups. n &lt;- 100 break_left &lt;- c(0, 3, 6, 8) break_right &lt;- c(3, 6, 8, 12) # 22 students spent more than six hours -&gt; 5 students spent more than 12 hours, # 17 student spent between six and height hours f &lt;- c(0.3, 0.48, 0.17, 0.05) tbl &lt;- tibble(break_left = break_left, break_right = break_right, rel_frequency = f) %&gt;% mutate(abs_frequency = rel_frequency * n) %&gt;% mutate(cum_rel_frequency = cumsum(rel_frequency)) %&gt;% mutate(cum_abs_frequency = cumsum(abs_frequency)) tbl ## # A tibble: 4 x 6 ## break_left break_right rel_frequency abs_frequency cum_rel_frequen~ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 3 0.3 30 0.3 ## 2 3 6 0.48 48 0.78 ## 3 6 8 0.17 17 0.95 ## 4 8 12 0.05 5 1 ## # ... with 1 more variable: cum_abs_frequency &lt;dbl&gt; A.4.3 Visualize the absolute frequencies. ggplot(tbl) + geom_rect( aes( xmin = break_left, xmax = break_right, ymin = 0, ymax = abs_frequency / (break_right - break_left) ), fill = &quot;gray&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) + labs(x = &quot;x&quot;, y = &quot;h(x)&quot;) A.4.4 Why did you choose this kind of visualization? I choose a histogram as it is a meaningful visualization for ratio-scaled data. Dont forget to divide by the group width. The area of a group is proportionate to its absolute frequency and not its height. A.4.5 Visualize the relative cumulative frequencies. x &lt;- c(0, tbl$break_right) cum_rel_frequency &lt;- c(0, tbl$cum_rel_frequency) tbl &lt;- tibble(x = x, cum_rel_frequency = cum_rel_frequency) ggplot(tbl, aes(x = x, y = cum_rel_frequency)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;x&quot;, y = &quot;F(x)&quot;) A.4.6 Which assumption was made for your visualization? The distribution within a group is uniform. A.4.7 Use your visualization to find out how many hours at most spent 50% of all students? # Interpolation t_max &lt;- 3 + (0.5 - 0.3) / (0.78 - 0.3) * (6 - 3) t_max ## [1] 4.25 A.4.8 How many students work more than five hours per day for their studies? # F(5) F_5 &lt;- 0.3 + (5 - 3) / (6 - 3) * (0.78 - 0.3) F_5 ## [1] 0.62 # Solution (1 - F_5) * n ## [1] 38 A.5 Exercise A5 This exercise does not cover anything new and is therefore left as an exercise to the reader. Ice cream seller Benedict wants to sell fresh ice cream to his customers every day. So that he always has the right quantities in stock, he counts the consumption of ice cream scoops on one day for 200 customers. Here it turns out: No customer is ordering two scoops or more than six scoops. 20% each wanted one scoop or at least five scoops. Less than three scoops were ordered by 45% of all customers. Ten times more customers wanted four or six scoops than five scoops. A.5.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? A.5.2 Determine absolute and cumulative absolute frequencies. A.5.3 Visualize the absolute frequencies. A.5.4 Visualize the relative cumulative frequencies. A.5.5 What percentage of customers ordered five or less scoops? A.5.6 How many scoops were bought from the 80% customers with the most scoops? A.5.7 How many scoops were bought from exact 35% of customers?

For this purpose he needs all orders with the respective quantities [in thousands of pieces]. The computer of the company provides him with the data of this week in the following graphic representation: B.3.1 What is the statistical feature? How is it scaled? B.3.2 Determine absolute and relative frequencies. B.3.3 Determine (without calculating) the value of the arithmetic mean and the median. Justify your answer briefly. B.3.4 Determine the empirical variance. B.3.5 Group order quantities in the following groups: 0 - 20 | 20 - 40 | 40 - 60 B.3.6 Determine the value of the arithmetic mean and the empirical variance from the grouped data. B.3.7 Explain possible differences of the parameter values between original and grouped data The production manager wants to distribute the production of the ordered tools to the three machines A, B and C. Machine A is to produce exactly 40% of this weeks order volume. For technical reasons, the quantity produced by machine B depends on the production quantity of machine A and is only 25% of the quantity produced by machine A. The rest of the order volume is to be produced by machine C. B.3.8 How many tools are produced by machine A? B.3.9 What percentage of the total order volume is produced by machine B? B.3.10 How many tools are produced by machine C? B.4 Exercise B3 As part of a medical examination, 200 people were asked how many cups of coffee they drink per week. The result of this examination is shown in the following graph: B.4.1 What do you call this graphic representation? What was assumed about the distribution of the data? B.4.2 Draw the absolute frequency distribution. Which principle should be observed? B.4.3 Determine the arithmetic mean and median from the data. B.4.4 Interpret both values in terms of how the data is distributed. B.4.5 Indicate the percentage of people who drink at least 20 cups of coffee per week. Lets assume that when you look through the data again, you find that the frequencies of the 3rd group and the 4th group have been swapped. B.4.6 Does this change the value of the median? B.5 Exercise B4 An arithmetic mean of \\(\\bar{x} = 2813\\) was determined from \\(n = 78\\) observations. In addition to these observations, an observation of 2100 was added. B.5.1 What is the arithmetic mean now? (1 / 79) * (78 * 2813 + 2100) ## [1] 2803.975 B.6 Exercise B5 Bert is a computer freak. In order to avoid losing touch with the computer world, he likes to be kept up to date with all the latest developments. For this purpose he connected his computer (all day long) to a so-called internet server, for which he has to pay hefty telephone charges. Due to a tariff change of the telephone company, Bert now fears that he can no longer afford this luxury, which is exactly the case when he has to pay more than 6 EUR per hour on average for the telephone connection. Tariff Time from  up to less than  Talk time in seconds per cost unit of 8 Cent Night Tariff 01:00 - 06:00 120 Morning Tariff 06:00 - 12:00 40 Afternoon Tariff 12:00 - 19:00 30 Evening Tariff 19:00 - 01:00 60 B.6.1 Calculate for the new tariff how much the telephone connection costs on average in EUR per hour. So can Bert still afford his hobby in the future? B.7 Exercise B6 The following empirical distribution function \\(F(x)\\) was obtained for the monthly gross income [in 1000 EUR] of the 2000 employees of a company: B.7.1 What is the name of the statistical feature examined here and how is it scaled? B.7.2 Determine the absolute and the relative frequency distribution of this characteristic B.7.3 Visualize the absolute frequency distribution. B.7.4 According to your visualization, how big is the percentage of employees who earn exactly 6400 EUR per month? B.7.5 Calculate how many percent of the employees earn more than 5800 EUR per month. B.7.6 What is the (estimated) monthly gross income of all employees of this company? B.7.7 What is the average monthly gross income in this company B.7.7.1 by the arithmetic mean? B.7.7.2 by the median? B.7.8 Calculate the empirical quartile coefficient of skewness. B.7.9 Assess the skewness of the present frequency distribution B.7.9.1 according to the position rule. B.7.9.2 according to the empirical quartile coefficient of skewness. B.8 Exercise B7 Multiple Choice Questions One speaks of the principle of equal area when, in the graphic representation of absolute frequencies of grouped data, the flatness of a block is proportional to the absolute frequency to be represented. True. The frequency distributions of two cardinally scaled features do not have to be identical even if the two features have the same arithmetic mean and the same variance. True. Statistical quantities can be classified with respect to their value range. True. The empirical distribution function is not only defined for values that were also observed. False? Empirical means observed. One could argue that she could use aggregated values instead of bare observations. The empirical quartile distance of an ordered data set is a measure of variability which is outlier-sensitive. False. The step heights of an empirical (relative) distribution function correspond to the relative cumulative frequencies. False, they correspond to the relative frequencies. The coefficient of variation is a dimensionless measure. True. If: \\(h(a_j) = n\\) , then the underlying statistical characteristic has only one possibility of realization. False. Other possible realizations were just not observed, but may surely exist. A train travels \\(97 \\, \\mathrm{km}\\) at a speed of \\(64 \\frac{\\mathrm{km}}{\\mathrm{h}}\\) and another \\(97 \\, \\mathrm{km}\\) at a speed of \\(192 \\frac{\\mathrm{km}}{\\mathrm{h}}\\) . Then the average speed for the total distance is 96km/h. True. \\(\\frac{97 \\, \\mathrm{km} + 97 \\, \\mathrm{km}}{\\frac{1}{64} \\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{km}} \\cdot 97 \\, \\mathrm{km} + \\frac{1}{192} \\frac{\\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{km}} \\cdot 97 \\, \\mathrm{km}} = 96 \\frac{\\mathrm{km}}{\\mathrm{h}}\\). A statistical characteristic is called continuous if its range of values is countably infinite. False. Its range must be uncountably infinite.

D.2 Exercise D2 In the context of developing a marketing strategy for their latest product, the marketing department of a company conducted a survey in the hope of obtaining information about the most promising packaging color. For this purpose, a total of 600 units of the product were offered on three different test markets. Several employees have so far collected the following information about the pieces sold in the test markets: The number of units sold on test market I was in line with the packaging color (black, red, white) in the ratio 1:3:1. 30% of the pieces sold on the Test Market II were packed in black. 25% of all offered pieces were not sold. As many black-packaged pieces were sold as white-packaged pieces. 175 pieces were sold on Test Market III. The number of pieces sold on Test Market II represented 75% of the total number of red wrapped pieces sold on all Test Markets. On Test Market I, 50 fewer pieces were sold than on Test Market III. 35% of the red wrapped pieces sold were sold on Test Market III.
