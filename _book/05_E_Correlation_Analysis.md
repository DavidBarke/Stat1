## Exercise E5

A psychologist investigates different work groups in a company to see if there is a connection between the attractiveness of a work group (cohesion and well-being of its members) and the variance of its work performance.

Group attractiveness was measured using an ordinal scale from 1 = very high to 6 = very low. The variance in performance refers to the number of products completed by a work group on different days. The study produced the following result: 


|Work Group | Attractiveness| Variance in Performance|
|:----------|--------------:|-----------------------:|
|A          |              1|                      32|
|B          |              2|                      20|
|C          |              2|                      40|
|D          |              3|                      32|
|E          |              4|                      64|
|F          |              5|                      68|
|G          |              6|                      60|
